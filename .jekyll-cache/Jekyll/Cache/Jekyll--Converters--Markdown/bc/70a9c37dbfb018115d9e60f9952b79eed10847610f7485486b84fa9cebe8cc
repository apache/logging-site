<p>The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating security problems and denial 
of service attacks against its products.</p>

<p>We strongly encourage folks to report such problems to our private security mailing list first, 
before disclosing them in a public forum.</p>

<p>Please note that the security mailing list should only be used for reporting undisclosed security 
vulnerabilities and managing the process of fixing such vulnerabilities. We cannot accept regular 
bug reports or other queries at this address. All mail sent to this address that does not relate 
to an undisclosed security problem in our source code will be ignored.</p>

<p>If you need to report a bug that isn‚Äôt an undisclosed security vulnerability, please use the 
project‚Äôs issue tracker.</p>

<p>The private security mailing address is: <a href="mailto:%73%65%63%75%72%69%74%79%40%61%70%61%63%68%65%2E%6F%72%67">security@apache.org</a></p>

<h2 id="asking-questions-about-known-security-problems">Asking Questions About Known Security Problems</h2>

<p>Questions about:</p>

<ol>
  <li>if a vulnerability applies to your particular application</li>
  <li>obtaining further information on a published vulnerability</li>
  <li>availability of patches and/or new releases</li>
</ol>

<p>should be addressed to the users mailing list. Please see the <a href="/mailing-lists.html">mailing lists page</a>
for details of how to subscribe.</p>

<h2 id="known-security-vulnerabilities">Known Security Vulnerabilities</h2>

<p>Known security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache Logging projects are listed in 
specific pages for each project.</p>

<p>If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other unexpected behaviour that has 
security impact, or if the descriptions in one of the pages are incomplete, please report them 
privately to the Apache Security Team. Thank you.</p>
