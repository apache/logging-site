# Guidelines

Logging Services is a _project_ of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org) (ASF) and composed of several _subprojects_; Log4cxx, Log4j, Log4Net, etc.
Logging Services _Project Management Committee (PMC)_ is responsible for the management of the project and all its subprojects.
Committers and PMC members are elected due to merit for the evolution of the project.
Changes and releases are subject to voting.
All ASF projects are operated using this governance model, which is further documented in the following pages:

* [How the ASF works](https://apache.org/foundation/how-it-works)
* [The ASF FAQ](http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html)
