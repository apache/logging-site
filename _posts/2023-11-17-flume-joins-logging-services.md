# Welcoming the Flume Team to Logging Services

We are excited to announce that **Apache Flume** is now a part of our Logging Services family. 
Flume is renowned for its distributed, reliable, and available service, specializing 
in efficiently collecting, aggregating, and moving large volumes of log data.

The journey of Flume has been remarkable. Unfortunately, the Flume team had struggles
with growing and remained a small team. Still, they caught the attention
of several Logging Services committers. Impressed by its 
capabilities and potential, both the Flume community and our team saw a 
unique opportunity for collaboration and bringing to small teams together.

## A Unified Force in Logging

This integration is more than just a merger of two services; it's the coming 
together of like-minded communities aiming for excellence in logging solutions. 
The decision to merge was driven by our shared vision of offering robust, 
scalable, and efficient logging services.

## Extending Our Portfolio

Flume's addition significantly extends our own Logging portfolio. Its unique approach 
to handling large-scale log data complements our existing solutions, creating a 
more comprehensive suite of tools for our users.

## Looking Forward

Plans are already underway to push Flume to a new release, one that incorporates 
our combined expertise and the latest in logging technology.


## Free and Open Source, Apache License

As always, Apache Flume is developed under the Apache License. You can find its

Flume's ongoing development.

## Join Us

We are also opening our doors wider, welcoming new contributors and other 
interested individuals who wish to be part of this exciting journey. Whether
