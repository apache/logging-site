# Welcoming Jan Friedrich to the Apache Logging Services PMC

We are happy to announce that Jan Friedrich has been invited to join the Apache Logging Services PMC. Jan joined the project only this year. His contributions to Log4net have been substantial and have significantly improved the project.

Instead of introducing him ourselves, we asked Jan to share a little of himself:

"I'm Jan Friedrich (FreeAndNil), hailing from Germany, and I've been a developer for 25 years. Over the past two decades, I've specialized in Delphi & C# and have nearly 20 years of experience using log4net. For the past two years, I've also been actively contributing to the development of log4net. On a personal note, I'm a proud parent of three wonderful kids. I look forward to sharing my expertise and learning from all of you."
