# Apache Log4j participates in the bug bounty program

We have been very proud to be [supported by the STF](/blog/2023/12/14/announcing-support-from-the-stf.html) last year.
We were able to fix many bugs, rewrite documentation, and improve the overall quality of the codebase and security.

We won't stop here. With the help of the [YesWeHack](https://yeswehack.com/programs/log4j-bug-bounty-program) bug bounty program, we can now offer you a chance to hunt bugs for Log4j and get paid for it.

We would not be able to participate in such a program. 

Luckily, our friends from the STF have helped us get the funds necessary to pay for the bugs you find.
They are offering their help not only to us but to many other projects as well.
If you want to learn more about what they do, please read their [official announcement on their website](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/news/calling-all-security-researchers).

We want to thank the STF and YesWeHack for their support and hope you will help us make Log4j even more secure.
