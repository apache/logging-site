[#issues]
== Issues

The Log4j project uses https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues[GitHub Issues] as its issue tracking system.
The old issue tracking system, https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/LOG4J2[JIRA], is still accessible, though only recommended for issues that were already created there.

Issues get resolved in one of the following ways:

. The reporter or another interested party provides https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pulls[a pull request] tagging the issue in its title
. A committer is interested in the issue and decides to work on it
. The reporter or another interested party sponsors one or more of xref:#sponsorship[the committers listed below] to encourage them to work on the issue

Created issues are subject to the following policy:

Quality::
Issues posted of insufficient quality will be removed

No protracted discussions::
Issues likely to result in protracted discussion must be posted to the mailing lists

No Questions::
Do not post questions as issues!
These will be removed, and you will be asked to post questions to the mailing lists instead.

[#sponsorship]
== Sponsorship

Sponsorship can be used simply as a way to say thank you for the work that has been done or as a way to encourage specific issues to be worked on.
In either case, while the Apache Logging Services project thanks you for your support, we cannot be responsible for any promises and/or contributions made by an individual committer, as individual commits must be reviewed and accepted by the project team.

== Third-party commercial support

While neither the Apache Software Foundation nor the Apache Logging Services project provide any commercial support for the Log4j products, individual committers may collaborate with services that provide such support.

The following aims to be a list of all commercial support services involving one or more Log4j committers.
