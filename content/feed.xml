<p>Today, December 17, 2023 marks a significant milestone for the Apache Logging Services project, 
as we celebrate 20 years since the inception of Log4j 1. 
This journey, spanning two decades, has been one of constant evolution, growth, and community spirit.</p>

<h2 id="a-timeline-of-success-and-learning">A Timeline of Success and Learning</h2>

<p>From the early days of Log4j 1, we have witnessed numerous releases, 
welcomed many new committers and PMC members, and seen the launch of various side
projects as Log4xx, Chainsaw or Log4php. The recent addition of 
Apache Flume has further broadened our suite of logging
tools, showcasing our commitment to providing diverse and robust solutions.</p>

<p>We are incredibly proud of the learning curve we experienced with Log4j 1. 
Every mistake was a stepping stone towards the development of Log4j 2, 
which has surpassed all our previous projects in scope and impact.</p>

<h2 id="overcoming-challenges-together">Overcoming Challenges Together</h2>

<p>The Log4shell incident was a critical period for us. However, the strength 
and support of not only our community but also the global open-source community 
were astounding. Together, we transformed a challenge into an opportunity to create
the most secure logging framework to date. The extensive code reviews and 
collaborative efforts post-Log4shell have significantly fortified 
Log4j’s security features.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead-with-excitement">Looking Ahead with Excitement</h2>

<p>The future looks bright as we eagerly anticipate the release of Log4j 3. 
Alongside, we are preparing for new versions of Apache Flume, a logging processor, 
and other exciting side projects. These developments are a testament to our 
commitment to innovation and excellence.</p>

<h2 id="a-community-that-values-collaboration">A Community That Values Collaboration</h2>

<p>At the heart of our success is our community spirit, perfectly encapsulated 
in the Apache Software Foundation’s motto, “Community Over Code.” 
This philosophy has been our guiding light, ensuring that we prioritize 
collaboration, mutual respect, and collective growth.</p>

<p>We warmly invite you to join us in this celebratory moment. Whether you 
are a seasoned contributor or new to the open-source world, there is a 
place for you in the Apache Logging Services community. Together, let’s 
continue to innovate, learn, and build a future that echoes the resilience 
and spirit of the past two decades.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Apache Log4j" /><category term="Anniversary" /><category term="Open Source" /><category term="Community" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marking 20 years of growth and resilience with Apache Log4j, from its inception in 2003 to the upcoming launch of Log4j 3.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Log4j: A New Chapter with STF Funding</title><link href="/blog/2023/12/14/announcing-support-from-the-stf.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Log4j: A New Chapter with STF Funding" /><published>2023-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/blog/2023/12/14/announcing-support-from-the-stf</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2023/12/14/announcing-support-from-the-stf.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="receiving-support-from-the-sovereign-tech-fund">Receiving Support from the Sovereign Tech Fund</h1>

<p>For a long time, Apache Log4j has thrived through the dedication and contributions 
of our community, relying mostly on unpaid volunteers. Today, we’re excited to announce 
a pivotal moment in our journey – the Sovereign Tech Fund (STF) has chosen to 
support us for the further development of specific Log4j projects.</p>

<p>The STF, known for its commitment to critical projects 
(<a href="https://www.sprind.org/de/projekte/sovereign-tech-fund/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a>), 
recognizes the significance of Log4j in the global tech landscape. This support 
is a testament to the essential role Log4j plays in the IT infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="focused-development-and-security-enhancement">Focused Development and Security Enhancement</h2>

<p>We’re honored that three of our maintainers - <a href="https://grobmeier.solutions">Christian Grobmeier</a>, 
Piotr Karwasz, and <a href="https://volkan.yazi.ci">Volkan Yazıcı</a> - are being supported through 
this initiative. Collaborating closely with the Project Management Committee (PMC), 
their focus will be on enhancing security, elevating code quality, and adding new, 
advanced features.</p>

<p>We have already made significant progress: implemented a CI-based
release pipeline, modernized the code base and dependencies, started
publishing <a href="https://logging.apache.org/logging-parent/latest/#cyclonedx-sbom">Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR)</a>
for released artifacts, and several other enhancements. This funding 
will also enable us to substantially improve our documentation, tests, and overall stability.</p>

<h2 id="broadening-our-horizons">Broadening Our Horizons</h2>

<p>This is an extraordinary opportunity for Log4j and the Logging Services team. It enables us to refine our library, 
making it more user-friendly and maintaining our position as a leading logging solution. 
Our team’s size and expertise allow us to respond swiftly to security issues. 
With the STF’s support, we can further enhance the security and stability that 
enterprises and our diverse user base have come to expect from us.</p>

<p>Without this funding, many of these improvements would not have been feasible. 
It marks a significant leap in our ability to serve the community and 
contribute to the open-source ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="acknowledgments-and-future-endeavors">Acknowledgments and Future Endeavors</h2>

<p>On a personal note, we would like to extend our gratitude to the (<a href="https://www.inoeg.de/">InÖG</a>) 
for their pivotal role in facilitating these developments. As they made us aware of the STF 
during our participation in their remarkable project “<a href="https://www.dialog-cybersicherheit.de/b3/">Buntes Bug Bounty</a>” 
program, a commendable open source project to bolster software security 
(<a href="https://www.dialog-cybersicherheit.de/workstreams/">Dialog-Cybersicherheit</a>) in Germany.</p>

<p>As we embark on this new chapter, we invite the global tech community to join us 
in celebrating this milestone. Your support and contributions have brought us here, 
and together, we’ll continue to strengthen the foundation of digital infrastructure 
for a safer, more robust technological future.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Apache Log4j" /><category term="Sovereign Tech Fund" /><category term="Open Source" /><category term="Community" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Celebrating a significant milestone in Log4j's journey with support from the Sovereign Tech Fund.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Upgrade to Apache Commons Logging 1.3.0</title><link href="/blog/2023/12/02/apache-common-logging-1.3.0.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Upgrade to Apache Commons Logging 1.3.0" /><published>2023-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/blog/2023/12/02/apache-common-logging-1.3.0</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2023/12/02/apache-common-logging-1.3.0.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="apache-commons-logging">Apache Commons Logging</h1>

<p><a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/">Apache Commons Logging</a> (JCL) is one of the oldest Java logging API
available.
Released for the first time in 2002, it immediately saw a widespread adoption in the Java community.</p>

<p>While newer APIs, like SLF4J and our own Log4j API, appeared over time, even in 2023 it is hard to find an application stack
that does not depend on JCL.
According to Sonatype, Apache Commons Logging is used in <a href="https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/commons-logging/commons-logging">over 1 million artifacts</a>,
while the second place is taken by SLF4J with <a href="https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-api">almost 40 thousand artifacts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="version-130">Version 1.3.0</h2>

<p>After more than 9 years since its previous release (version 1.2 released in July 2014), Apache Commons Logging released
a new 1.3.0 version today (cf. <a href="https://lists.apache.org/thread/wx6v7wwhbnk64nx708hszctzv8fdsvdl">announcement</a>).
Among the most prominent changes, the new version:</p>

<ul>
  <li>forwards logging to the Log4j API out-of-the-box (if present),</li>
  <li>also supports forwarding to SLF4J,</li>
  <li>adds support for the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) with the module name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.apache.commons.logging</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="upgrade-instructions-log4j-corelogback">Upgrade instructions (Log4j Core/Logback)</h2>

<p>The upgrade path for users of the Log4j Core and Logback logging backends is easy.
The first step is upgrading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commons-logging</code>.
In Maven this can be done using dependency management.</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;dependencies&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;dependency&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>commons-logging<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>commons-logging<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>1.3.0<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/dependency&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/dependencies&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second step consists in removing obsolete dependencies.
Since version 1.2 only supported old generation logging backends out-of-the-box (<a href="https//logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/">Log4j 1.x</a>,
<a href="https//avalon.apache.org">Avalon</a> and <a href="https://javalogging.sourceforge.net">Lumberjack</a>), the Java community developed
many <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogFactory</code> implementations and complete Apache Commons Logging replacements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/jcl-over-slf4j"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j</code></a> (replacement),</li>
  <li><a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-jcl"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.springframework:spring-jcl</code></a> (replacement),</li>
  <li>our own <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-jcl"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-jcl</code></a>
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogFactory</code> implementation).</li>
</ul>

<p>These artifacts can be <strong>safely</strong> removed from your dependency stack.
For JPMS users this operation is even <strong>required</strong>.</p>

<p>To do so Maven users can use exclusions:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;dependency&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>org.springframework<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>spring-jcl<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;exclusions&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;exclusion&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>org.springframework<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>spring-jcl<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/exclusion&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/exclusions&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/dependency&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and to prevent regressions, add those dependencies to a <a href="https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/bannedDependencies.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannedDependencies</code> Maven Enforcer rule</a>.</p>

<h2 id="upgrade-instructions-log4j-1xreload4j-users">Upgrade instructions (Log4j 1.x/Reload4j users)</h2>

<p>For users that use Log4j 1.x or Reload4j as logging backend the upgrade is more complicated: version 1.3.0 disabled the Log4j 1.x backend by default.</p>

<p>Log4j 1.x/Reload4j users are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encouraged to migrate to Log4j 2.x Core (cf. <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html">migration guide</a>) or Logback,</li>
  <li>if that is not possible (or if a transitional period is required) they need to add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commons-logging.properties</code> file to their applications containing:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log = org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4JLogger
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="jpms-users">JPMS users</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.apache.commons.logging</code> JPMS module has an <strong>optional</strong> dependency on the Log4j API.
In order for the JVM to automatically add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.apache.logging.log4j</code> module to your application’s runtime, you need to add:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>requires org.apache.logging.log4j;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to your application’s module descriptor.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Apache" /><category term="Commmons Logging" /><category term="Open Source" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instructions to upgrade application to Apache Commons Logging 1.3.0.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcoming Stephen Webb to the Apache Logging Services PMC</title><link href="/blog/2023/11/28/new-pmc-member.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcoming Stephen Webb to the Apache Logging Services PMC" /><published>2023-11-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-11-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/blog/2023/11/28/new-pmc-member</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2023/11/28/new-pmc-member.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="welcoming-stephen-webb-to-the-apache-logging-services-community">Welcoming Stephen Webb to the Apache Logging Services community</h1>
