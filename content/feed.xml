<p>A <strong>Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)</strong> is a machine-readable file used to indicate whether vulnerabilities in an application’s third-party dependencies are actually exploitable.</p>

<p>We first encountered the term “VEX” in 2023 when we began publishing SBOMs and Vulnerability Disclosure Reports (VDRs) for Log4j, as part of <a href="https://logging.apache.org/blog/2023/12/14/announcing-support-from-the-stf.html">a larger STF initiative</a>. That work gave us the chance to learn directly from experts like <a href="https://owasp.org/www-board-candidates/2023/steve_springett">Steve Springett</a> (whom we sincerely thank for his time and patience). One key takeaway from that experience: there are <strong>two ways</strong> in the CycloneDX machine-readable format for conveying vulnerability information in software components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <strong>Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR)</strong> lists vulnerabilities <strong>present</strong> in a software component. There’s debate about whether it should also include third-party dependency vulnerabilities, but in the case of Log4j (a Java library that bundles no third-party dependencies), the answer is clear: it does not matter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <strong>Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)</strong> goes further, analysing whether the vulnerabilities present are <strong>actually exploitable</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="why-we-skipped-the-vex-for-log4j">Why We Skipped the VEX for Log4j</h1>

<p>Maintaining VEX files can be expensive—some companies spend hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars each year to process and manage them. The cost typically scales with the number of CVEs that need to be evaluated annually.</p>

<p>For commercial entities that keep parts of their SBOM private, the bar is higher: <strong>they must include every CVE in their VEX</strong> to meet regulatory or contractual obligations, since clients are not able to determine whether a dependency is present or not in the product.</p>

<p>Open Source projects, on the other hand, often operate under different constraints. Since we publish a full SBOM that transparently lists all dependencies, we could reasonably limit our scope to just those declared dependencies—about 100 across all Log4j modules.</p>

<p>Still, even 100 dependencies represent a significant burden when all analysis must be done by volunteers in their spare time. Given that reality, we made a pragmatic decision: rather than invest that effort into producing and maintaining a VEX, we chose to only publish a VDR, which only lists the vulnerabilities in our own codebase.</p>

<h1 id="when-the-absence-of-a-vex-became-a-problem">When the Absence of a VEX Became a Problem</h1>

<p>At first, we were comfortable with our decision. But that changed when we helped Kafka migrate from Log4j 1 to Log4j 2. I suggested using more human-friendly YAML-formatted configuration files, only to be met with <a href="https://lists.apache.org/thread/khm0jn9f0vgp30pfyoy6jc0qy46sbklp">valid concerns</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">log4j-core</code> and its optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jackson-dataformat-yaml</code> dependency could introduce security risks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parsers are common sources of CVEs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While Log4j doesn’t bundle dependencies (we only provide metadata and recommendations), Kafka’s situation is different—each vulnerability in its transitive dependencies could force a new release.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>That experience revealed a key blind spot: even if <em>we</em> know certain dependencies aren’t exploitable, our users don’t. They spend unnecessary time analyzing risks that don’t exist. For example, in Log4j Core, the parsing capabilities of Jackson are only used to read <strong>trusted</strong> configuration files—so typical parser vulnerabilities aren’t exploitable. But this nuance wasn’t documented <strong>anywhere</strong> that automated scanners could read.</p>

<h1 id="vex-ante-litteram">VEX <em>ante litteram</em></h1>

<p>Log4j Core is a very controlled consumer of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jackson-dataformat-yaml</code>. But what about other consumers? Would they be vulnerable to transitive dependencies like SnakeYAML? You’d think so—but when I thoroughly analyzed several SnakeYAML CVEs, none turned out to be exploitable through Jackson.</p>

<p>Still, that kind of analysis is extremely time-consuming:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Identify the exact method that caused the CVE (rarely detailed in CVE descriptions).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Analyze how, if at all, that method can be reached through your dependency tree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Confirm there’s no sanitization or validation on any reachable path.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Surprisingly, some of this work has already been done for years by maintainers! For example, downstream projects often raise issues like:</p>

<p>“Please upgrade <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> to version 1.2.3 due to CVE-2025-1234.”</p>

<p>What this request actually means is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Please confirm your library is <strong>compatible</strong> with the patched version.</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Please tell us whether the vulnerability is <strong>exploitable</strong>.</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These human-readable questions are, in effect, <em>VEX requests</em>. Some examples can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed%20snakeyaml%20cve"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jackson-dataformats-text</code> repository</a>.</p>

<p>These kinds of request leave Open Source maintainers two choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Publish machine-readable VEXes so tools can automatically dismiss non-exploitable issues and many user questions can be avoided.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or answer these questions only manually—repeatedly, and often redundantly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toward-faster-smarter-vexes">Toward Faster, Smarter VEXes</h1>

<p>The turning point came at FOSDEM 2025, where I met <strong>Munawar Hafiz (OpenRefactory)</strong>. As we discussed the VEX burden, we realized much of the manual analysis could be automated.</p>

<p>In the months that followed, Munawar’s team built a prototype that automates two key parts of VEX creation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Identifying the vulnerable method(s) in a dependency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tracing all possible paths from the application to the vulnerability.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This drastically reduces the time needed to analyze each new CVE. The human factor remains essential (at least until tools like CycloneDX Threat Models become fully automated), but the workload is now much more manageable.</p>

<h1 id="vexes-come-to-open-source">VEXes Come to Open Source</h1>

<p>As of <strong>July 2025</strong>, we’re excited to share that a new <strong>VEX Initiative</strong> has been launched by the <strong>Alpha-Omega Fund</strong>. It will release OpenRefactory’s tooling under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apache-2.0</code> license and integrate it into Apache Solr workflows.</p>

<p>The goal: generate more accurate and timely VEX files. For example, the first CVE addressed—<a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-48924"><strong>CVE-2025-48924</strong></a> (an infinite recursion in a Commons Lang method)—was reported just days after the initiative started. The analysis showed Solr was <em>not</em> vulnerable, meaning users don’t need to rush to upgrade to the next release.</p>

<p>This is only the beginning. We aim to push this effort up the dependency chain—supporting not just Solr, but also projects like Log4j and Apache Commons. This collaborative model allows us to <strong>distribute the effort</strong>: both the computational workload of automated analysis and the human effort required to review, validate, and interpret the results.</p>

<p>By working together across projects, we can reduce duplication, increase accuracy, and accelerate the delivery of trustworthy VEX files—benefiting the entire open source ecosystem.</p>

<h1 id="what-it-means-for-you">What It Means for You</h1>

<p>Under the EU’s <strong>Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)</strong>, commercial vendors must ensure that:</p>

<p>“Products with digital elements shall be made available on the market without known exploitable vulnerabilities.”</p>

<p>Improved VEX tooling and publishing open up two practical paths for meeting the requirements of the CRA:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Patch your Solr installations</strong> to use dependency versions that are free of known CVEs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Leverage the Apache Solr VEX file</strong> to demonstrate to regulators that known vulnerabilities are <em>not exploitable</em> in your context.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>If you choose the second approach—and you have internal insights into the exploitability of vulnerabilities in your open source–based products—<strong>don’t keep that knowledge to yourself</strong>. Contributing your findings upstream helps the broader ecosystem. By sharing what you’ve already analyzed, you enable other organizations to invest their resources into analyzing vulnerabilities in other OSS projects—possibly the same ones you rely on.</p>

<p>It’s a win-win: stronger shared security, reduced duplication of effort, and a more resilient open source supply chain.</p>

<p>Today, December 17, 2023 marks a significant milestone for the Apache Logging Services project, 
as we celebrate 20 years since the inception of Log4j 1. 
This journey, spanning two decades, has been one of constant evolution, growth, and community spirit.</p>

<h2 id="a-timeline-of-success-and-learning">A Timeline of Success and Learning</h2>

<p>From the early days of Log4j 1, we have witnessed numerous releases, 
welcomed many new committers and PMC members, and seen the launch of various side
projects as Log4xx, Chainsaw or Log4php. The recent addition of 
Apache Flume has further broadened our suite of logging
tools, showcasing our commitment to providing diverse and robust solutions.</p>

<p>We are incredibly proud of the learning curve we experienced with Log4j 1. 
Every mistake was a stepping stone towards the development of Log4j 2, 
which has surpassed all our previous projects in scope and impact.</p>

<h2 id="overcoming-challenges-together">Overcoming Challenges Together</h2>

<p>The Log4shell incident was a critical period for us. However, the strength 
and support of not only our community but also the global open-source community 
were astounding. Together, we transformed a challenge into an opportunity to create
the most secure logging framework to date. The extensive code reviews and 
collaborative efforts post-Log4shell have significantly fortified 
Log4j’s security features.</p>

<h2 id="looking-ahead-with-excitement">Looking Ahead with Excitement</h2>

<p>The future looks bright as we eagerly anticipate the release of Log4j 3. 
Alongside, we are preparing for new versions of Apache Flume, a logging processor, 
and other exciting side projects. These developments are a testament to our 
commitment to innovation and excellence.</p>

<h2 id="a-community-that-values-collaboration">A Community That Values Collaboration</h2>

<p>At the heart of our success is our community spirit, perfectly encapsulated 
in the Apache Software Foundation’s motto, “Community Over Code.” 
This philosophy has been our guiding light, ensuring that we prioritize 
collaboration, mutual respect, and collective growth.</p>

<p>We warmly invite you to join us in this celebratory moment. Whether you 
are a seasoned contributor or new to the open-source world, there is a 
place for you in the Apache Logging Services community. Together, let’s 
continue to innovate, learn, and build a future that echoes the resilience 
and spirit of the past two decades.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Apache Log4j" /><category term="Anniversary" /><category term="Open Source" /><category term="Community" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Marking 20 years of growth and resilience with Apache Log4j, from its inception in 2003 to the upcoming launch of Log4j 3.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Log4j: A New Chapter with STF Funding</title><link href="/blog/2023/12/14/announcing-support-from-the-stf.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Log4j: A New Chapter with STF Funding" /><published>2023-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/blog/2023/12/14/announcing-support-from-the-stf</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2023/12/14/announcing-support-from-the-stf.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="receiving-support-from-the-sovereign-tech-fund">Receiving Support from the Sovereign Tech Fund</h1>

<p>For a long time, Apache Log4j has thrived through the dedication and contributions 
of our community, relying mostly on unpaid volunteers. Today, we’re excited to announce 
a pivotal moment in our journey – the Sovereign Tech Fund (STF) has chosen to support us in the further development of specific Log4j projects.</p>

<p>The STF, known for its commitment to critical projects 
(<a href="https://www.sprind.org/de/projekte/sovereign-tech-fund/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a>), 
recognizes the significance of Log4j in the global tech landscape. This support 
is a testament to the essential role Log4j plays in the IT infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="focused-development-and-security-enhancement">Focused Development and Security Enhancement</h2>

<p>We’re honored that three of our maintainers - <a href="https://grobmeier.solutions">Christian Grobmeier</a>, 
Piotr Karwasz, and <a href="https://volkan.yazi.ci">Volkan Yazıcı</a> - are being supported through 
this initiative. Collaborating closely with the Project Management Committee (PMC), 
their focus will be on enhancing security, elevating code quality, and adding new, 
advanced features.</p>

<p>We have already made significant progress: implemented a CI-based
release pipeline, modernized the code base and dependencies, started
publishing <a href="https://logging.apache.org/logging-parent/latest/#cyclonedx-sbom">Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) and Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR)</a>
for released artifacts, and several other enhancements. This funding 
will also enable us to substantially improve our documentation, tests, and overall stability.</p>

<h2 id="broadening-our-horizons">Broadening Our Horizons</h2>

<p>This is an extraordinary opportunity for Log4j and the Logging Services team. It enables us to refine our library, 
making it more user-friendly and maintaining our position as a leading logging solution. 
Our team’s size and expertise allow us to respond swiftly to security issues. 
With the STF’s support, we can further enhance the security and stability that 
enterprises and our diverse user base have come to expect from us.</p>

<p>Without this funding, many of these improvements would not have been feasible. 
It marks a significant leap in our ability to serve the community and 
contribute to the open-source ecosystem.</p>

<p><a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-logging/">Apache Commons Logging</a> (JCL) is one of the oldest Java logging API
available.
Released for the first time in 2002, it immediately saw a widespread adoption in the Java community.</p>

<p>While newer APIs, like SLF4J and our own Log4j API, appeared over time, even in 2023 it is hard to find an application stack
that does not depend on JCL.
According to Sonatype, Apache Commons Logging is used in <a href="https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/commons-logging/commons-logging">over 1 million artifacts</a>,
while the second place is taken by SLF4J with <a href="https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.slf4j/slf4j-api">almost 40 thousand artifacts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="version-130">Version 1.3.0</h2>

<p>After more than 9 years since its previous release (version 1.2 released in July 2014), Apache Commons Logging released
a new 1.3.0 version today (cf. <a href="https://lists.apache.org/thread/wx6v7wwhbnk64nx708hszctzv8fdsvdl">announcement</a>).
Among the most prominent changes, the new version:</p>

<ul>
  <li>forwards logging to the Log4j API out-of-the-box (if present),</li>
  <li>also supports forwarding to SLF4J,</li>
  <li>adds support for the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) with the module name <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.apache.commons.logging</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="upgrade-instructions-log4j-corelogback">Upgrade instructions (Log4j Core/Logback)</h2>

<p>The upgrade path for users of the Log4j Core and Logback logging backends is easy.
The first step is upgrading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commons-logging</code>.
In Maven this can be done using dependency management.</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;dependencyManagement&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;dependencies&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;dependency&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>commons-logging<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>commons-logging<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;version&gt;</span>1.3.0<span class="nt">&lt;/version&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/dependency&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/dependencies&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/dependencyManagement&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second step consists in removing obsolete dependencies.
Since version 1.2 only supported old generation logging backends out-of-the-box (<a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.x/">Log4j 1.x</a>,
<a href="https://avalon.apache.org">Avalon</a> and <a href="https://javalogging.sourceforge.net">Lumberjack</a>), the Java community developed
many <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogFactory</code> implementations and complete Apache Commons Logging replacements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.slf4j/jcl-over-slf4j"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.slf4j:jcl-over-slf4j</code></a> (replacement),</li>
  <li><a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-jcl"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.springframework:spring-jcl</code></a> (replacement),</li>
  <li>our own <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-jcl"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-jcl</code></a>
(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LogFactory</code> implementation).</li>
</ul>

<p>These artifacts can be <strong>safely</strong> removed from your dependency stack.
For JPMS users this operation is even <strong>required</strong>.</p>

<p>To do so Maven users can use exclusions:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;dependency&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>org.springframework<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>spring-jcl<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;exclusions&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;exclusion&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;groupId&gt;</span>org.springframework<span class="nt">&lt;/groupId&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;artifactId&gt;</span>spring-jcl<span class="nt">&lt;/artifactId&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/exclusion&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/exclusions&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/dependency&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and to prevent regressions, add those dependencies to a <a href="https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/bannedDependencies.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bannedDependencies</code> Maven Enforcer rule</a>.</p>

<h2 id="upgrade-instructions-log4j-1xreload4j-users">Upgrade instructions (Log4j 1.x/Reload4j users)</h2>

<p>For users that use Log4j 1.x or Reload4j as logging backend the upgrade is more complicated: version 1.3.0 disabled the Log4j 1.x backend by default.</p>

<p>Log4j 1.x/Reload4j users are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>encouraged to migrate to Log4j 2.x Core (cf. <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html">migration guide</a>) or Logback,</li>
  <li>if that is not possible (or if a transitional period is required) they need to add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commons-logging.properties</code> file to their applications containing:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>org.apache.commons.logging.Log = org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4JLogger
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="jpms-users">JPMS users</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.apache.commons.logging</code> JPMS module has an <strong>optional</strong> dependency on the Log4j API.
In order for the JVM to automatically add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.apache.logging.log4j</code> module to your application’s runtime, you need to add:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>requires org.apache.logging.log4j;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to your application’s module descriptor.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Apache" /><category term="Commmons Logging" /><category term="Open Source" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Instructions to upgrade application to Apache Commons Logging 1.3.0.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcoming Stephen Webb to the Apache Logging Services PMC</title><link href="/blog/2023/11/28/new-pmc-member.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcoming Stephen Webb to the Apache Logging Services PMC" /><published>2023-11-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-11-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/blog/2023/11/28/new-pmc-member</id><content type="html" xml:base="/blog/2023/11/28/new-pmc-member.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="welcoming-stephen-webb-to-the-apache-logging-services-community">Welcoming Stephen Webb to the Apache Logging Services community</h1>
