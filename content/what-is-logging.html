        <h1>What is logging?</h1>
<p>At a high level, logging is used to capture information during the run of an<br />
application.  This can include different types of information about both the<br />
state of the application and inputs to the application.  For example, an HTTP<br />
server may log information about incoming connections(such as an IP address).<br />
Logging can also be at different levels of verbosity, in order to allow a user<br />
of the application to not be overwhelmed with too much information.</p>
<p>Logging can be broadly classified into two categories.  The two main categories<br />
of logging are debug logging and audit logging.  Debug logging is generally<br />
useful for application developers who can turn on messages that an end-user<br />
does not care about - for example, if data is being parsed correctly, or if an<br />
exception is thrown.  Audit logging is more interesting to system<br />
administrators.  This type of data would include information such as when<br />
somebody logged in, who changed a piece of information, etc.  Debug logging and<br />
audit logging are not mutually exclusive, and there can be plenty of overlap<br />
between these two categories.</p>
<h1>What should a logging framework do?</h1>
<p>At a minimum, a logging framework needs to be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily allow you to create log messages</li>
<li>Send log messages to stdout and/or stderr</li>
<li>Be completely transparent to your application - your application should<br />
behave exactly the same no matter if logging is enabled or disabled</li>
</ul>
<p>However, a logging framework that does only these things is not particularly<br />
useful, and no better than using System.out.println() or printf().  Common<br />
features of logging frameworks generally include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to send log messages to other places than just stdout/stderr.  For<br />
example, common places to send logs could be:<br />
** syslog<br />
** A file on the local filesystem<br />
** Remote log server(e.g. ELK, Splunk, kibana, etc.)<br />
** Windows event log<br />
** Database</li>
<li>Filtering based off of levels and data</li>
<li>Location information of where the log statement is in the code</li>
<li>Allow for rotation of files when logging to a file.  This allows you to do<br />
things such as creating a new log whenever you start up, doing one log file per<br />
day, limiting files to a specific size, etc.</li>
<li>Log to multiple locations at once(send the same data to stdout and a file for<br />
example)</li>
<li>Classify messages based off of the particular subsystem that they are from</li>
<li>Format log messages according to some user-defined pattern</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list of all features that could exist.  There are<br />
many different logging frameworks that exist which may implement different<br />
subsets of these features, and may also have more features than are listed here.</p>
<h1>Log Levels and Subsystem Classification</h1>
<p>When you are logging information, two of the most important things to know are<br />
the level of the log message and the subsystem that the log message is from.<br />
This allows you to determine how severe something is, as well as where it is<br />
coming from.</p>
<p>The traditional log levels are as follows(from most verbose to least verbose):<br />
TRACE<br />
DEBUG<br />
INFO<br />
WARN<br />
ERROR</p>
<p>In addition, levels of CRITICAL and FATAL may exist as well.  Generally, FATAL<br />
indicates that the application is about to exit, while CRITICAL is similar to<br />
ERROR.</p>
<p>Levels make it easy to quickly filter messages.  Since more verbose messages<br />
still allow less verbose messages to be printed, you don't lose information by<br />
turning the verbosity up.  When you are working on a particular subsystem, you<br />
may want that subsystem to be at the DEBUG level to see all the messages, or<br />
TRACE if there is something that you really need to see.  As a general rule of<br />
thumb, when your application is in production the default level of all loggers<br />
should be at the INFO level.</p>
<p>Subsystems help to classify the data as well.  In Java, this is generally done<br />
by the package that a class is in.  Being able to set a particular subsystem<br />
that you are debugging to the DEBUG level(and not just a single class) is an<br />
important part of being able to easily filter information and to not overload<br />
the programmer who is debugging the application.</p>
<p>Within the Apache Logging Services projects(log4j2, log4cxx, and log4net) this<br />
subsystem classification follows the Java hierarchical approach.  If you have a<br />
logger org.apache.Foo and org.apache.Bar, you can set the level of org.apache<br />
to DEBUG and both loggers will be at the DEBUG level, but can also be<br />
individually set if required.  This hierarchical way of logging is not a<br />
feature that all logging frameworks have, however it is very useful if your<br />
code is organized in a way such that all classes have individual loggers and<br />
are logically separated into subsystems appropriately.  This also allows for<br />
more granular control over your debug statements.</p>
<h1>Where to put logs?</h1>
<p>Logging to different locations(sometimes called sinks) is an important part of<br />
logging frameworks.  For simple applications, you may not need to do anything<br />
more complicated than just send data to stdout and/or a file.  However, more<br />
complicated applications quickly need to have more flexibility in how and where<br />
they log information.  Modern applications can log to web-based log aggregators<br />
in addition to a local log mechanism such as syslog.</p>
<p>By configuring these log locations through an external source such as a config<br />
file, it also makes it possible for the end-user to configure the system for<br />
their particular use-case.</p>
<h1>Transparent Logging</h1>
<p>One of the most basic tenets of logging is that it needs to be completely<br />
transparent to your application.  Your application must not care if logging is<br />
enabled or disabled: all it does is send messages to the logging framework,<br />
which then handles all of the filtering and routing required to get the message<br />
to its final destination.  This also makes it possible to write unit tests that<br />
don't care about logging at all.  If the logging system is not initialized, the<br />
worst that should happen is that nothing gets logged.</p>
<h1>How to do proper logging</h1>
<p>Now that we understand what the normal features of logging libraries are,<br />
it’s time to talk about how to do proper logging.  As we’ve mentioned<br />
before, the two main things to worry about when logging are what the level of<br />
the message is, and the classification of the log message.  For the<br />
classification of the log message, this will often be the name of the class<br />
that is doing the logging.  Assuming that you have a good design already, then<br />
the classification derives clearly from the name of the class and the<br />
package/namespace the class is in.</p>
<p>Choosing the level of the log message can be a bit trickier.  A good rule of<br />
thumb is to leave your log messages at INFO level during normal operation, so<br />
what should we put at that level and what should be more verbose?  Let’s<br />
assume that we are opening a network socket for remote communications.  At the<br />
INFO level we may inform that the network subsystem is starting up and ready<br />
for work.  DEBUG information could include new connections from clients with<br />
their IP/port combination, while TRACE information could be output whenever a<br />
packet comes in from a client.  In addition, we may have ERROR messages if we<br />
are unable to open a socket for reading/writing.</p>
<p>By having different pieces of the data flow at different log levels, it makes<br />
it easy to quickly look at the logs and determine how serious a problem is and<br />
what the system is doing during operation.</p>
<h1>Other things to worry about when logging</h1>
<p>As we have seen, having a good logging framework is critical to being able to<br />
find and fix errors in applications.  However, just because we have logging<br />
doesn’t mean that it is infallible.  Since logging code that you insert into<br />
your application is still code that you have written, it is always possible<br />
that the log messages you get out are lying to you due to a bug in a log<br />
statement.</p>
<h1>Features that the Apache Logging Services projects have</h1>
<p>While there are many different logging frameworks that exist for Java, C++, and<br />
.NET, there are a number of built-in features that Log4j2, Log4cxx, and Log4net<br />
have that are generally useful.</p>
<h2>Hierarchichal Logging</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously, hierarchical logging allows for easy grouping of<br />
subsystem information.  This allows you to have fine-grained control over the<br />
information that you are logging and easily allows for one logger per-class.</p>
<p>This hierarchical logging also means that you don't need to explicitly share<br />
a sink between loggers.  While it is possible to configure Log4j2 and Log4cxx<br />
to send each logger to a separate location, the parent/child relationship means<br />
that children will log their messages to any sinks that their parents have.</p>
<h2>Location Information</h2>
<p>Knowing exactly where a log statement is can be vital in order to track down<br />
the location of a log statement.  Both Log4j2 and Log4cxx are able to determine<br />
the filename, class name, method name, and line number where the log message<br />
is coming from.  With Log4cxx, this is able to be done at compile-time.</p>
<h2>Static and Single-instance Loggers</h2>
<p>All loggers that are created with Log4j2 and Log4cxx are able to be declared<br />
as static variables in your source file, eliminating the need for a dedicated<br />
instance variable of a logger per-class.  A side effect of this is that there<br />
is a global logger registry, so that you can access the same logger via a<br />
static LogManager in different classes without having to pass the logger around.</p>
<h2>Nested and Mapped Diagnostic Contexts</h2>
<p>When you have multiple objects of the same type, using a static logger can be<br />
problematic when you need to only view data for one instance of the class.  By<br />
providing a Nested Diagnostic Context and a Mapped Diagnostic Context, it is<br />
possible to add context information to your log statements.</p>
<h2>Flexible Log Message Formatting</h2>
<p>When sending a log message to a flat text file, it is often desirable to have<br />
the messages in a simple to understand format.  This information can include<br />
data such as the date/time of the log message, the level of the message, the<br />
logger that produced the message, and the message itself.  With the Log4j2<br />
and Log4cxx PatternLayout classes, it is possible to quickly configure the<br />
logging system to output information in a convenient format.</p>
<p>Different types of log message formatting is also important when you need<br />
to send messages to different locations.  The code that creates the log messages<br />
should not know anything about how the message is formatted on the backend.<br />
This allows for the same log message to be formatted in different ways with<br />
potentially different metadata - for example, JSON format for a log aggregating<br />
service, or plain text for a local configuration file.</p>
<h2>Configuration via config file</h2>
<p>Both Log4j2 and Log4cxx can be configured with a configuration file in one of<br />
several different formats.  While it is always possible to configure via code,<br />
configuration files make it easy to reconfigure the system without having to<br />
recompile your code.  This also means it is possible to edit a configuration<br />
file and dynamically change the configuration at runtime.  For example, you<br />
can turn on a logger that was previously off if you are debugging a live<br />
system.</p>
<h2>Garbage-free(Log4j2)</h2>
<p>In Java, it is important to reduce the amount of time that the garbage<br />
collector takes to run.  By not allocating and freeing objects, your<br />
log statements will add very little to the runtime overhead of your application.</p>
<h2>Formatting with replacements</h2>
<p>When creating a log statement, it is often slow and annoying to perform string<br />
concatenation to create a log statement.  In Java, the simplest way to<br />
concatenate a string is to simply use the + operator:</p>
<pre><code>log(&quot;Logging information: &quot; + someVariable + &quot; and the other variable is &quot; + otherVariable);
</code></pre>
<p>While in C++, you can get into a chevron overload:</p>
<pre><code>log(&quot;Logging information: &quot; &lt;&lt; someVariable &lt;&lt; &quot; and the other variable is &quot; &lt;&lt; otherVariable);
</code></pre>
<p>Both Log4j2 and Log4cxx allow for variable replacements in strings, such that<br />
the above log statements can both be written similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>log(&quot;Logging information: {} and the other variable is {}&quot;, someVariable, otherVariable);
</code></pre>
<h2>Filtering</h2>
<p>When you have many different log messages that you are trying to make sense of,<br />
it can be difficult to focus on the correct piece of information.  Because of<br />
this, it is possible to configure both Log4j2 and Log4cxx to filter certain<br />
messages based off of various attributes, such as a text string that is contained<br />
within the log message.  Since these filters are also able to be configured<br />
through the confgiuration file, adding or removing filters is a simple operation.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Logging is a rather complicated topic that covers many different aspects.  While<br />
different applications will have different requirements for their log statements,<br />
the projects of the Apache Logging Services Commitee provide a generic and<br />
widely applicable implemenation of logging for all kinds of applications.</p>
